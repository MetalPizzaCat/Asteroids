# Asteroids

A very simple recreation of Asteroids using [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/)

This project was made to test out Kotlin + LibGDX and practice both. In reality this is far more complex that it needed to be. 
However, the main goal was to test out various features and ideas for possible future projects and it was easier to do that with a much simpler project.

### Controls
* Left/Right arrow - rotate the ship
* Up arrow - move forward
* Space - shoot
* S - restart(when dead)

### Note
Sounds were made using SFXR, music is just random stuff I threw together in MuseScore
